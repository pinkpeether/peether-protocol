Peether: open-source settlement infrastructure for ride-hailing networks. It enables any ride-hailing platform to: - Pay drivers/commuters in PTDT Token - Convert PTDT to local fiat (on-demand) - Operate independently (❌ central authority) - Scale globally (one codebase, infinite deployments). Ride-hailing deserve global decentralized compensation.
